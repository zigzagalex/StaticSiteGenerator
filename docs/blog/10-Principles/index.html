    <article><div><h1>10 Principles, 0 Bullsh*t: Why Dieter Rams Still Runs Modern Design</h1><p><img src="/StaticSiteGenerator/images/dieter-rams-sketch.jpeg" alt="Dieter Rams sketching a Braun radio" /></p><p>Let’s cut through the noise: <b>Dieter Rams basically invented the aesthetic you're scrolling through right now.</b> Apple, Muji, IKEA — all sipping from his minimalist fountain of design truth.</p><blockquote>"Weniger, aber besser."  — Dieter Rams</blockquote><p>Here’s how his <b>10 principles of good design</b> are not just alive — they’re running the modern world. With examples to prove it.</p><h2>1. Good design is innovative</h2><p>Rams didn’t just make new things — he made <b>new ways to use things</b>. The Braun T3 radio (1958) was revolutionary in how it simplified user interaction.</p><p><b>Modern echo:</b> Apple’s original iPod. Scroll wheel? Pure Rams minimalism, modernized.</p><h2>2. Good design makes a product useful</h2><p>Form always follows <b>function</b> in Rams' world. His 606 shelving system isn’t just beautiful — it adapts to the user, not the other way around.</p><p><b>Modern echo:</b> IKEA’s modular storage units. Functional first, aesthetic second.</p><h2>3. Good design is aesthetic</h2><p>But don’t get it twisted — Rams knew beauty matters. The Braun SK 4 radiogram (1956) made electronics living-room-worthy.</p><p><b>Modern echo:</b> The iMac. Tech that actually belongs on your desk, not hidden under it.</p><h2>4. Good design makes a product understandable</h2><p>Look at the Braun ET 66 calculator. No manual. Just <b>clarity.</b> Each button does one thing, and it does it well.</p><p><b>Modern echo:</b> Google’s homepage. One box. One button. Zero confusion.</p><h2>5. Good design is unobtrusive</h2><p>The Braun LE1 speaker (1959) blends into the room. Rams never wanted his products to scream — they <b>whisper function with elegance.</b></p><p><b>Modern echo:</b> Muji. Literally their whole vibe.</p><h2>6. Good design is honest</h2><p>Rams hated fake. No fake materials. No fake features. What you see is what you get.</p><p><b>Modern echo:</b> Framework laptops — upgradeable, transparent, honest tech.</p><h2>7. Good design is long-lasting</h2><p>His designs don’t age. The RT 20 radio still looks modern. He wasn’t chasing trends — he was building <b>timelessness</b>.</p><p><b>Modern echo:</b> Braun clocks still sold today with the same design.</p><h2>8. Good design is thorough down to the last detail</h2><p>Nothing was random. Every knob, every corner on a Rams product is <b>intentional.</b></p><p><b>Modern echo:</b> Notion's UI. Every pixel has a purpose.</p><h2>9. Good design is environmentally friendly</h2><p>Rams was preaching sustainability before it was cool. Durable, modular, fixable — nothing disposable.</p><p><b>Modern echo:</b> Fairphone. Repairable smartphones with ethics in the circuit board.</p><h2>10. Good design is as little design as possible</h2><p>The most famous line. The Braun HL 70 desk fan didn’t add flair — it <b>stripped away everything unnecessary.</b></p><p><b>Modern echo:</b> The MacBook Air. Just enough. Never more.</p><h3>Dieter Rams isn’t just a legend — he’s a blueprint.</h3><p>His design principles apply to <b>hardware, software, websites, even code.</b> Want your project to stand the test of time? Channel Rams:</p><ul><li>Strip it down.</li><li>Make it useful.</li><li>Let it breathe.</li></ul><p>Minimalism isn’t emptiness. It’s <b>intention.</b></p><p>Want more Rams?
