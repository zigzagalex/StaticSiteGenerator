    <article><div><h1>Braun > Beats: Dieter Rams Designed the Future Before You Were Born</h1><p><img src="/StaticSiteGenerator/images/braun-ipod.png" alt="Braun T3 Radio vs iPod side by side" /></p><p>Let’s make this clear: <b>before Apple was cool, Braun was cooler.</b> And at the heart of it all? Dieter Rams — the quiet revolutionary who shaped modern tech design before most of us were born.</p><blockquote>"You cannot understand good design if you do not understand people."  — Dieter Rams</blockquote><p>This isn’t just a "he influenced some products" situation — this is <b>design DNA theft in plain sight</b>, and it’s glorious.</p><p>---</p><h2>🎛️ Braun T3 Radio (1958) → iPod (2001)</h2><p>White, compact, minimalist — the T3 radio is literally the iPod’s aesthetic ancestor. Flat face, clear buttons, one function per part.</p><p>Jony Ive didn’t reinvent the wheel. He just made it click.</p><p>---</p><h2>🧮 Braun ET 66 Calculator (1987) → iPhone Calculator</h2><p>Still sold today. Still perfect. Apple straight-up cloned its layout for the iOS calculator — not inspired, <b>copied.</b></p><p>Because you don’t improve on perfection. You just digitize it.</p><p>---</p><h2>📻 Braun SK 4 Radiogram (1956) → Every Turntable You Love</h2><p>A transparent lid? Back in the ‘50s? Yep. That clean modern vibe from Pro-Ject or even IKEA’s turntables — <b>he did it first.</b></p><p>It’s called the "Snow White’s Coffin" for a reason: beautiful and ahead of its time.</p><p>---</p><h2>🪞 Braun LE1 Speakers (1959) → Sonos Era</h2><p>Minimal, sleek, rectangular. Designed to <b>blend</b>, not brag. Rams believed speakers were furniture — not showpieces.</p><p>Sonos, Bang & Olufsen, IKEA’s SYMFONISK? That’s Rams whispering in their design language.</p><p>---</p><h2>🧊 Braun HL 70 Desk Fan (1961) → Muji’s Modern Fans</h2><p>Functional geometry. Matte finish. No noise, literally and visually. Modern minimalist fans follow the same blueprint.</p><p>Because why reinvent a fan when Rams already made the perfect one?</p><p>---</p><h2>🧳 Braun TP 1 (1959) → Record Players with Handles</h2><p>Portable audio? Rams did it in the 50s. The TP 1 was a suitcase-shaped combo of record player and radio — clean, matte, everything today’s hipster gear wishes it was.</p><p>---</p><h2>📐 Braun 606 Shelving (1960) → Vitsœ 606 (Still Sold!)</h2><p>The system design icon. Rams helped make modularity beautiful. The same shelves are still sold today through Vitsœ — because <b>great design doesn’t expire.</b></p><p>---</p><h2>🧠 Why It Matters</h2><p>Dieter Rams didn’t just influence modern tech — he predesigned it. Apple, Muji, IKEA, and Sonos aren’t just "inspired by Rams" — they’re <b>built on him</b>.</p><p>Rams said more by designing less. And in a world overloaded with noise, <b>less still wins.</b></p><p>---</p><blockquote>Want to see his principles in action?
