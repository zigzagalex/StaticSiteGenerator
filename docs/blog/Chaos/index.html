    <article><div><h1>Why Your Website Needs a Little More Rams and a Lot Less Chaos</h1><p><img src="/StaticSiteGenerator/images/Vitra-606.jpeg" alt="Cluttered website vs clean Rams design" /></p><p>Your website is trying to say one thing, but it's drowning in popups, banners, five different fonts, and seventeen CTA buttons.</p><p>Dieter Rams would be horrified. And he’d be right.</p><blockquote>"Good design is as little design as possible."  — Dieter Rams</blockquote><p>Let’s fix it.</p><p>---</p><h2>1. Strip it down</h2><p>Rams believed in removing the unnecessary until only the essential remains. Most websites today? The opposite.</p><p><b>Do this:</b> - Cut your homepage content in half. - Kill anything that moves unless it’s critical. - Stick to one typeface. Maybe two.</p><p><b>Rams-style example:</b> Notion, Apple.com, or basically any Muji product page.</p><p>---</p><h2>2. Guide, don’t shout</h2><p>Good design is <b>understandable</b>. Rams’ Braun T3 radio had one dial. Your site shouldn’t feel like a cockpit.</p><p><b>Do this:</b> - One clear primary CTA. - Use space to guide the eye. - Don’t compete with yourself visually.</p><p><b>Rams-style example:</b> Dropbox’s old landing page — one job, done well.</p><p>---</p><h2>3. No fake features</h2><p>Rams hated inauthenticity. If your button isn’t clickable, don’t make it look like one. If your animation doesn't help, lose it.</p><p><b>Do this:</b> - Only use animations for <b>actual feedback</b>. - Make things do what they look like they do.</p><p><b>Rams-style example:</b> Clean checkout flows (Stripe, Gumroad). Honest UX.</p><p>---</p><h2>4. Prioritize durability</h2><p>Rams built products to last decades. Your site might not need to last that long, but it <b>shouldn’t break next month.</b></p><p><b>Do this:</b> - Use fewer dependencies. - Test your layout at different screen sizes. - Be boring in the best way.</p><p><b>Rams-style example:</b> Basecamp. Quietly functional. Still works.</p><p>---</p><h2>5. Details matter</h2><p>Every pixel is a design decision. Rams would rather cut a feature than make it ugly.</p><p><b>Do this:</b> - Align your text. Like, actually align it. - Match your spacing system. - Don’t eyeball anything — use grids.</p><p><b>Rams-style example:</b> Framer, Vercel, Linear. Precision everywhere.</p><p>---</p><h3>The TL;DR:</h3><ul><li>Simpler is better.</li><li>Clear is kind.</li><li>Honest design builds trust.</li></ul><p>Good design is good UX. And Dieter Rams was doing it before UX was even a word.</p><p>Want to see Rams' 10 principles in action?

It needs a Rams design.</p></div></article>
