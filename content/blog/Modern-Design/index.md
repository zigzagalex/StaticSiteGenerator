# Braun > Beats: Dieter Rams Designed the Future Before You Were Born

![Braun T3 Radio vs iPod side by side](/images/braun-ipod.png)

Let’s make this clear: **before Apple was cool, Braun was cooler.** And at the heart of it all? Dieter Rams — the quiet revolutionary who shaped modern tech design before most of us were born.

> "You cannot understand good design if you do not understand people."

> — Dieter Rams

This isn’t just a "he influenced some products" situation — this is **design DNA theft in plain sight**, and it’s glorious.



## 🎛️ Braun T3 Radio (1958) → iPod (2001)

White, compact, minimalist — the T3 radio is literally the iPod’s aesthetic ancestor. Flat face, clear buttons, one function per part. 

Jony Ive didn’t reinvent the wheel. He just made it click.



## 🧮 Braun ET 66 Calculator (1987) → iPhone Calculator

Still sold today. Still perfect. Apple straight-up cloned its layout for the iOS calculator — not inspired, **copied.**

Because you don’t improve on perfection. You just digitize it.



## 📻 Braun SK 4 Radiogram (1956) → Every Turntable You Love

A transparent lid? Back in the ‘50s? Yep. That clean modern vibe from Pro-Ject or even IKEA’s turntables — **he did it first.**

It’s called the "Snow White’s Coffin" for a reason: beautiful and ahead of its time.



## 🪞 Braun LE1 Speakers (1959) → Sonos Era

Minimal, sleek, rectangular. Designed to **blend**, not brag. Rams believed speakers were furniture — not showpieces.

Sonos, Bang & Olufsen, IKEA’s SYMFONISK? That’s Rams whispering in their design language.



## 🧊 Braun HL 70 Desk Fan (1961) → Muji’s Modern Fans

Functional geometry. Matte finish. No noise, literally and visually. Modern minimalist fans follow the same blueprint.

Because why reinvent a fan when Rams already made the perfect one?



## 🧳 Braun TP 1 (1959) → Record Players with Handles

Portable audio? Rams did it in the 50s. The TP 1 was a suitcase-shaped combo of record player and radio — clean, matte, everything today’s hipster gear wishes it was.



## 📐 Braun 606 Shelving (1960) → Vitsœ 606 (Still Sold!)

The system design icon. Rams helped make modularity beautiful. The same shelves are still sold today through Vitsœ — because **great design doesn’t expire.**



## 🧠 Why It Matters

Dieter Rams didn’t just influence modern tech — he predesigned it. Apple, Muji, IKEA, and Sonos aren’t just "inspired by Rams" — they’re **built on him**.

Rams said more by designing less. And in a world overloaded with noise, **less still wins.**
