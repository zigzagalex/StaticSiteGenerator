Let’s cut through the noise: **Dieter Rams basically invented the aesthetic you're scrolling through right now.** Apple, Muji, IKEA — all sipping from his minimalist fountain of design truth.

Here’s how his **10 principles of good design** are not just alive — they’re running the modern world. With examples to prove it.



## 1. Good design is innovative

Rams didn’t just make new things — he made **new ways to use things**. The Braun T3 radio (1958) was revolutionary in how it simplified user interaction. 

**Modern echo:** Apple’s original iPod. Scroll wheel? Pure Rams minimalism, modernized.



## 2. Good design makes a product useful

Form always follows **function** in Rams' world. His 606 shelving system isn’t just beautiful — it adapts to the user, not the other way around.

**Modern echo:** IKEA’s modular storage units. Functional first, aesthetic second.



## 3. Good design is aesthetic

But don’t get it twisted — Rams knew beauty matters. The Braun SK 4 radiogram (1956) made electronics living-room-worthy. 

**Modern echo:** The iMac. Tech that actually belongs on your desk, not hidden under it.



## 4. Good design makes a product understandable

Look at the Braun ET 66 calculator. No manual. Just **clarity.** Each button does one thing, and it does it well.

**Modern echo:** Google’s homepage. One box. One button. Zero confusion.



## 5. Good design is unobtrusive

The Braun LE1 speaker (1959) blends into the room. Rams never wanted his products to scream — they **whisper function with elegance.**

**Modern echo:** Muji. Literally their whole vibe.



## 6. Good design is honest

Rams hated fake. No fake materials. No fake features. What you see is what you get.

**Modern echo:** Framework laptops — upgradeable, transparent, honest tech.



## 7. Good design is long-lasting

His designs don’t age. The RT 20 radio still looks modern. He wasn’t chasing trends — he was building **timelessness**.

**Modern echo:** Braun clocks still sold today with the same design.



## 8. Good design is thorough down to the last detail

Nothing was random. Every knob, every corner on a Rams product is **intentional.**

**Modern echo:** Notion's UI. Every pixel has a purpose.



## 9. Good design is environmentally friendly

Rams was preaching sustainability before it was cool. Durable, modular, fixable — nothing disposable.

**Modern echo:** Fairphone. Repairable smartphones with ethics in the circuit board.



## 10. Good design is as little design as possible

The most famous line. The Braun HL 70 desk fan didn’t add flair — it **stripped away everything unnecessary.**

**Modern echo:** The MacBook Air. Just enough. Never more.



### Dieter Rams isn’t just a legend — he’s a blueprint.

His design principles apply to **hardware, software, websites, even code.** Want your project to stand the test of time? Channel Rams:

- Strip it down.
- Make it useful.
- Let it breathe.

Minimalism isn’t emptiness. It’s **intention.**
