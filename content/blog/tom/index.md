# Why Your Website Needs a Little More Rams and a Lot Less Chaos

![Cluttered website vs clean Rams design](/images/Vitra-606.jpeg)

Your website is trying to say one thing, but it's drowning in popups, banners, five different fonts, and seventeen CTA buttons.

Dieter Rams would be horrified. And he’d be right.

> "Good design is as little design as possible."

Let’s fix it.

## 1. Strip it down

Rams believed in removing the unnecessary until only the essential remains. Most websites today? The opposite.

**Do this:**
- Cut your homepage content in half.
- Kill anything that moves unless it’s critical.
- Stick to one typeface. Maybe two.

**Rams-style example:** Notion, Apple.com, or basically any Muji product page.

## 2. Guide, don’t shout

Good design is **understandable**. Rams’ Braun T3 radio had one dial. Your site shouldn’t feel like a cockpit.

**Do this:**
- One clear primary CTA.
- Use space to guide the eye.
- Don’t compete with yourself visually.

**Rams-style example:** Dropbox’s old landing page — one job, done well.

## 3. No fake features

Rams hated inauthenticity. If your button isn’t clickable, don’t make it look like one. If your animation doesn't help, lose it.

**Do this:**
- Only use animations for **actual feedback**.
- Make things do what they look like they do.

**Rams-style example:** Clean checkout flows (Stripe, Gumroad). Honest UX.

## 4. Prioritize durability

Rams built products to last decades. Your site might not need to last that long, but it **shouldn’t break next month.**

**Do this:**
- Use fewer dependencies.
- Test your layout at different screen sizes.
- Be boring in the best way.

**Rams-style example:** Basecamp. Quietly functional. Still works.

## 5. Details matter

Every pixel is a design decision. Rams would rather cut a feature than make it ugly.

**Do this:**
- Align your text. Like, actually align it.
- Match your spacing system.
- Don’t eyeball anything — use grids.

**Rams-style example:** Framer, Vercel, Linear. Precision everywhere.

### The TL;DR:

- Simpler is better.
- Clear is kind.
- Honest design builds trust.

Good design is good UX. And Dieter Rams was doing it before UX was even a word.
